      <h2>Agriculture:</h2>
      <p>We have been learning about closed loop farming, sustainable/unsustainable food systems, biomimicry, hydroponic farm design, plant nutrients, mycology and aquaponic farm design. <br>

Closed loop farming means there are no inputs or outputs to make a system function; however, there are no 100% closed loop systems, so the goal is to reduce the amount of inputs and outputs as much as possible. In farming this can look like: composting, hydroponics and aquaponics. 
<br>
Food systems are a complex network of factors that are related to, influence, and directly affect the production and consumption of food by a population. An unsustainable food system is one that cannot maintain its level/rate indefinitely (monocropping, commercial meat-packing industry, etc.). A sustainable food system is one that maintains its level/rate indefinitely (Chinatown, Manhattan food system, etc.). A sustainable food system must include and maintain environmental, economic, and social sustainability practices. Environmental sustainability means paying attention to resource usage (water, energy, nutrients, etc.) and making sure the system has the least amount of negative effects on the environment. Economic sustainability means that the system can flourish economically to sustain itself and its endeavours. Social sustainability means that they feed and foster the community that they operate in. 
<br>
Biomimicry (“Life Mimicking”) means drawing inspiration from nature for the designs of objects and systems. Some examples are: architecture inspired by termite mounds that create passive cooling structures, velcro, and wetsuits. 
<br>
We learned about growing plants in a solution of nutrients and water, aka hydroponics. We learned about the critical components of hydroponic systems (lighting, plants support, water circulation, and aeration). Some common examples of hydroponic systems include: the Kratky method, deep water culture (DWC), nutrient film technique (NFT), flood and drain/ebb and flow, aeroponics and fogponics. Some methods fit some plants better (ex: micro greens in flood and drain, leafy crops in NFT). We learned about various materials that can be used/implemented to build these systems (PVC, stones and clay pellets, peat plugs, air pumps, etc.) 
<br>
We learned about plants and the macronutrients (Carbon,
Hydrogen, Oxygen, Nitrogen, Phosphorus, Potassium, Sulfur, Calcium,
Magnesium) and the micronutrients (Iron, Manganese, Boron, Zinc, Molybdenum, Chlorine, Copper, Nickel) they require to grow. There are biological and synthetic nutrients available, each have their own benefits and drawbacks (biological has shorter shelf life, is expensive, etc. Synthetic is cheaper, easier to work with, but less sustainable, etc. 
<br>
Aquaponics combines hydroponics and aquaculture (fish farming). It creates a cycle that turns fish poop into usable nutrients for plants. This is done with the help of bacteria that break down the fish poop (NH4+ aka Ammonium) into NO2- (Nitrites) and then into NO3- (Nitrates) which can be used to feed plants. The few critical inputs required are light, fish food, extra nutrients, O2 and CO2. Parts of an aquaponic system include: fish tank, air pump, sediment tank/filter, a biofilter and a hydroponic system. The type of fish used depends on your needs/environment. Some common fish include: tilapia, trout, catfish, and bass. In an aquaponic system, correct pH is crucial and should be kept between 6.5 and 7.
<br>
Mushrooms are actually just a small part of a much bigger living organism/network. A mushroom is a fruiting body of a fungus that bears spores. Fungi are organisms that get their  food by dissolving molecules from the environment around them. They do not require photosynthesizing. Mycelium is the vegetative part of a fungus. Substrat is the material on which fungi will derive their nutrients from and grow on. Mushrooms can be grown outside using logs or woodchips, but require very specific environments. Many mushrooms can be grown indoors in a controlled environment. Some common substrates include: manure, straw, woodchips/sawdust, sterilized grains, coffee grounds, brewers waste, recycled paper, and food waste. The six phases of mushroom production are: composting pasturization, spawning, casing, pinning, and cropping.
<br>
We learned how Good Agricultural Practices (GAP)
is used to ensure that agricultural products are produced, packed, handled and stored in a way that minimizes any potential hazards (microbial pathogens, viruses, chemical contaminants) to the consumer. Participants earn the right to stamp their produce as GAP certified. We leaned about the different water testing intervals for different sources of water.  GAP is used to create a food safety program that is tailored to every individual farm. A food safety program should include : 
1. Farm Map
2. Packing/ Washing area diagram
3. All certifications of anyone who comes in contact with food or uses pesticides, or handles heavy machinery.
4. Emergency contacts
5. Food Safety/ Traceability plan
6. Schedules for sanitation and cleaning
<br>
We learned about different daily and intermittent checks to perform on hydroponic/aquaponic systems. Daily check examples include: leaks, clogs, and equipment failures. Intermittent check examples include: system integrity - like cracks in piping, etc., material durability, pathogen checks. Cleaning methods include: purging, system deep cleans, and frequent sanitization of other surfaces as needed. Acceptable cleaning products include: high proof alcohol, food grade hydrogen peroxide, bleach (in certain situations), food safe cleaning solutions (Steramine), and vinegar. Never use regular soap, detergents, or toxic chemicals like Lysol. It’s a good idea to design your farm system with maintenance in mind. Also make sure to design with safety in mind (keeping water and electricity separate, etc.). 
<br>
We learned about developing design plans for our farm systems. Some things to keep in mind are: goals of the farm, how to keep things simple,  identifying/preventing failures before they happen, and designing systems for long term use (parts that can be easily switched out, ease of access for harvesting/cleaning, emergency procedures, etc.).
<br>
We learned about different common pests and how to manage them in an ideal way. Some passive methods of pest management include: biosecurity measures, fans and air circulation, isolating affected plants, cleaning/disposing of waste material, and traps. Some active methods include: pruning and preemptive purging, hand removal/washing plants, organic/non-toxic pesticides, baits/traps and beneficial organisms (predatory mites, ladybugs, nematodes, lacewing larvae, spiders, etc.).
<br>
We went over seeding, transplanting, pruning, cloning and harvesting crops. Seedlings need high humidity. Some need light while others don’t. Some seeds might need treatment to germinate (stratification/scarification). Air circulation is necessary for mold prevention. Microgreens are an easy cash crop to grow. Transplanting plants should be done after the first set of true leaves grow. Pruning should always be done above the node. Harvests can be done totally or progressively, depending on the type of plant.

      <h2>Tech:</h2>
      <p>We have been learning about HTML/CSS, and responsive design.
      	<br>

HTML (Hyper Text Markup Language) creates tags that act as instructions for displaying content on the web and has the ability to format documents and link to other documents/resources. 
<br>
CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. It tells HTML elements how to be displayed on screen,
paper, or in other media. The anatomy of CSS includes: a CSS selector (what you want to add style to), property (how you want to change it - spacing, font size, color, etc.), and a property value (the value to adjust the property). The different methods of applying CSS include: inline (defined within a tag, applies only to that occurrence of that tag), internal/embedded (defined in the head section of the page and applies to that page only), and external (defined in a separate file, applies to everything that’s linked to the external style sheet. Class is for when you want to consistently style multiple elements throughout a page/site. ID if for when you have a single element on the page that will take the style. IDs must be unique.
<br>
Flexbox is a one dimensional layout model that deals with layout in one dimension at a time, 
either as a row or a column. It allows responsive elements in a container to be automatically arranged depending upon the screen size.
Bootstrap is a set of open source, user interface elements, layouts, and JavaScript tools that can help create responsive websites and web apps.
<br>
We continued learning about JavaScript, specifically loops, conditionals, arrays, and objects. Comparison operators are used in logical statements
to determine equality or difference between variables. Conditional statements are used to execute a block of code based on the condition. Arrays can hold many values under single a variable. Values can accessed by referring to an index number. The index is the position that the value is ordered in. Objects, like arrays, are variables that can hold multiple values. But instead of the values being identified with indices, they are identified with names, called properties. Loops can execute a block of code a desired number of times.

      <h2>Construction:</h2>
      <p>OSHA stands for Occupational Safety & Health Administration. It is a part of the Dept. Of Labor. Its mission is to sace lives, prevent injuries, and protect the health of American workers. It carries out its mission by maintaining the database (maintaining a reporting and record keeping system to keep track of job-related injuries and illnesses), standards and inspection (developing job safety and health standards and enforcing them through worksite inspections), and training (providing the right training). It is up to both the employers and the employees to maintain a safe working environment, by communicating openly and being aware of their surroundings. OSHA’s inspection priority from 1st to last is: imminent danger, fatality/catastophe, complaints/referrals, and programmed inspections.
      <br>
      I've learned about Keeping ears protected using various types of ear protection like over the ear muffs and earplugs. I’ve learned about wearing the proper PPE and when to wear it.

    	<h2>Hands On:</h2>
    	<p>The hierarchy of controls from most effective to least effective is: elimination, substitution, engineering controls, administrative controls, and PPE. We learned that prolonged exposure to 85dB or higher can lead to hearing loss. At 90dB OSHA requires ear protection. Heat exhaustion is when the body temp rises slowly. Heat stroke is when body temp rises quickly. Frostbite is when blood is so low temp that is sacrifices parts of the body (like fingers/toes) to contain energy for the organs. Silica is everywhere in the air and should not be breathed in. It is important to wear the appropriate PPE when doing construction. We learned about various tools including: ball peen hammer, claw hammer, framing hammer, flat bar, wrecking bar, mason hammer, mason chisel, wood chisel, pick mattock, long nose/needle nose pliers, wire cutters, linesman pliers, wire stripper, tin cutter, spud wrench, combination wrench, open ended/close ended wrench, adjustable wrench, socket wrench, flathead/phillips head/robertson and torx screwdriver, torpedo level, and plumb bob. Levelled means perfectly horizontal, plumb is perfectly verticle.
      <br>
      We learned how to properly hammer in and take out nails. We learned how to use a hand saw and a circular saw. We learned how to take apart an old wood pallet and upcycle it into a garden bed.
